There was an engineer, manager and programmer driving down a steep mountain road.  The brakes failed and the car careened down the road out of control.  Half way down the driver managed to stop the car by running it against the embankment narrowing avoiding going over a cliff.  They all got out, shaken by their narrow escape from death, but otherwise unharmed.  The manager said "To fix this problem we need to organize a committee, have meetings, and through a process of continuous improvement, develop a solution."  The engineer said "No that would take too long, and besides that method never worked before.  I have my trusty pen knife here and will take apart the brake system, isolate the problem and correct it."  The programmer said "I think you're both wrong!  I think we should all push the car back up the hill and see if it happens again."

Daddy, how was I born?  Ah, very well, one day you need to find out anyway!  Mom and Dad got together in a chat room.  Dad set up a date via e-mail with your Mom and we met at a cyber cafe.  We snuck into a secluded room, and then your mother downloaded from your dad's memory stick.  As soon as dad was ready for an upload, it was discovered that neither one of us had used a firewall.  Since it was too late to hit the delete button, nine months later the blessed virus appeared.  And that's the story.

God called Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Gates to come to a conference.  And when they were all there, God said, "I've got good news and I've got bad news. The bad news is that I'm really fed up with the way things are on Earth; so, I've decided to destroy it. The good news is that I'm giving you one week's notice." 
 So, Bill Clinton called into session the joint houses of Congress and announced, "I've got good news and I've got bad news. The good news is there is a God. The bad news is that he's going to destroy the Earth in one week."  
Boris Yeltsin called into session the Communist Party and announced, "I've got bad news and worse news. The bad news is that there is a God after all. And the worse news is that he's going to destroy the Earth in one week."  
Bill Gates called all of his programmers, marketing experts and administrators together and announced, "I've got good news and I've got better news. The good news is that God thinks I'm one of the three most important men on Earth. The better news is that we don't have to fix Windows 95."
